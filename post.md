# Introduction

Hey everyone! 👋 Here is a little personal project that I recently breathed new life into – my GitHub Search App!

## Background

Looking back, I built the first version of this while I was deep-diving into the world of REST APIs and figuring out how to fetch data. It was such a cool learning experience, and the app let developers quickly find and explore GitHub profiles in real-time.

## Updates

Fast forward to now, and I felt it was time to give it a major refresh! I spent some time modernizing the codebase, and honestly, it feels like a whole new app. Here's a peek at what I've been up to under the hood:

- 🚀 Switched from Create React App to Vite – the speed difference is amazing!
- 🗺️ Upgraded from React Router v4 to v6 – the routing is so much smoother now.
- ✨ Said goodbye to Bootstrap icons and welcomed React Icons for a more seamless React feel.
- 🎨 Gave the user interface a little love to make it even easier to use.

For those curious about what the app actually does, here are the main things:

- 🔍 Lets you search GitHub profiles in real-time.
- 👤 Shows you detailed info about users.
- 📂 Lists their repositories.
- 📱 Works great on any device, big or small.

And the tools that made it all happen?

- ⚛️ React (of course!)
- 🐙 The awesome GitHub REST API
- 🚦 React Router
- 🖼️ React Icons
- ⚡ Vite

This project isn't just lines of code to me; it represents my journey in web development and a personal commitment to keeping things up-to-date and easy to maintain.

If you're curious, feel free to give it a spin! I'd love to hear what you think: [https://coolgithub-search.netlify.app/]
