🚀 Excited to share my recently updated GitHub Search App!

I originally built this project while learning REST APIs & data fetching, and I've just completed a significant modernization of the codebase. This tool allows developers to easily search and explore GitHub user profiles in real-time.

🔧 Technical Updates:

- Migrated from Create React App to Vite for improved performance
- Upgraded to React Router v6 for better routing capabilities
- Replaced Bootstrap icons with React Icons for better React integration
- Refined the UI for enhanced user experience

💻 Key Features:

- Real-time GitHub profile search
- Detailed user information display
- Repository listings
- Responsive design

🛠️ Tech Stack:

- React
- GitHub REST API
- React Router
- React Icons
- Vite

This project represents both my journey in web development and my commitment to keeping codebases modern and maintainable.
